# Leap Motion Smart Home

This team project was meant as a demo to show people the possibilities of integrating Leap Motion in houses as a multi-purpose device controller. The user can interact with the virtual environment with real a Leap Motion as well, which controls a virtual hand cursor in 3D. Virtual Leap Motion devices are placed in each room of the house and can be used to trigger/control illumination, windows, TVs and such.

Project has yet to be uploaded on GitHub. Probably only relevant code will be, since .blend models used take up too much space.

[Here] a video of a working demo.
